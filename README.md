# Number-Generator/Guesser
To play the game, guess a number 1-999 inclusive and based off the hints, try to guess the number in the least amount of guesses you can.  
There are 3 versions of this game, 'number generator' or spunky apples is a game that generates random numbers for the user.  
Number guesser A is the first version of number guesser, and it doesn't have a button for the user to submit responses, so the guess counter doesn't really work.
Number guesser B is the final version and the version that works.  It has a button so the user can input numbers and the number counter works.
